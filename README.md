# GAN Getting Started - COMP433

A deep learning project exploring Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation and style transfer.

## Project Overview

This repository contains implementations and experiments with various GAN architectures, including DCGAN, FastCUT, and Latent-Diffusion models. The project focuses on training GANs on artistic datasets to generate novel images.
